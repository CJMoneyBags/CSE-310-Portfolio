# Overview

This is just a basic Tip calculator to get my self familiar with the Kotlin language and how to build Android apps using the Android Development Kit(ADK). I wanted to learn what it takes to make an app and decided to keep it simple.

Basically you put in your base amount and then use a slider for the percent of tip you want to give. The tip amount and total amounts are calculated and displayed.

# Development Environment

I used the Android Development Kit to organize the elements of my app and create the business logic in Kotlin to update the fields and do the calculations.
