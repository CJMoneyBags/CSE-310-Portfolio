# Overview

I have always loved video games as a kid and wanted to learn how the worked. I had an opportunity to learn the Unity Game Engine and develop a small platformer game. I wanted to learn what it takes to make characters move, enemies chase, and even how to collect coins for points.

This was a good challenge because I had to learn a bit of C# as well as some of how Unity works. I have a demo video playing through the game and describing some of the code.

# Development Environment
The main environment used is Unity as it provided all the organizations, sprite controls, physics, animations and more for my game. I found Unity as a very versatile program and has a lot to offer.

I also used Visual Studio to do my coding, Unity actually had me have it installed and start using it for coding. I have used Visual Studio before for other projects and I'm pretty well versed in using it.
